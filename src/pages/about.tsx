            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Our mission is to create a sustainable, affordable, and convenient way for parents to find quality baby items 
              while extending the lifecycle of products that still have plenty of use left in them. By facilitating the 
              second-hand market, we help:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce waste and promote sustainability</li>
              <li>Make quality baby items more affordable for all families</li>
              <li>Connect local parents and build community</li>
              <li>Simplify the buying and selling process</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
              Nifty Thrifty aggregates listings from various WhatsApp groups dedicated to second-hand baby items in Cape Town. 
              Our platform categorizes and organizes these listings, making them searchable and filterable by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Category (clothing, toys, furniture, etc.)</li>
              <li>Location within Cape Town</li>
              <li>Price range</li>
              <li>Item condition</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We also highlight "In Search Of" (ISO) posts, where parents are looking for specific items, 
              helping connect buyers with sellers more efficiently.
            </p>
